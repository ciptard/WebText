# WebText

WebText is a simple CMS. Simply create a text file in the 'content' folder and WebText will create a new page on your website with the contents of the text file. No database required.

Text files are parsed with Markdown, so you can do pretty much whatever you want with them.

WebText was created by [Sidney Kochman](http://kochman.org/).

## Install

* Copy all of the files to a web server running PHP. Make sure you grab the .htaccess file, too.
* Edit the site title in '_app/config.php'.
* Customize the template in '_app/template'.
* Enjoy!
